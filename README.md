## Assignment 1
This is the first assignment of the class IT00CD99 - Multidimensional Sensing TEchniques Fall 23.

To use the code, you need to install the dependencies generated by the environment.yaml file. To do so, run the following command in the terminal:
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yaml
```
Then, activate the environment by running the following command:
```bash
conda activate dev
```

To run the code, run the following command in the terminal:
```bash
python stepcounter.py -f <path_to_file> -a <algorithm> -w <window_size> -p <precision_threshold>
```
Where:
- **path_to_file** is the path to the file containing the data. The file should be in the data folder.
- **algorithm** is the algorithm used to calculate the step count. It can be either 'simple' or 'advanced'.
- **window_size** is the size of the window used to calculate the step count.
- **precision_threshold** is the threshold used to determine if a step is valid or not.
